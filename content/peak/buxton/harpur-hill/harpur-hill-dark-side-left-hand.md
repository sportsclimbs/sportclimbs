## Latest topo of far left

**9. It has to End Somewhere (6a)** slab trending leftwards to lower off.

**10. DNE (4)** pillar with a mantelshelf finale

**12. Will it Never End (4+)** left pillar

**13. Is this the End? (5)** central wall.

**14. Coming to an End (6a+)** slim pillar. Pleasant though short.

## New topo from guide

The main topo for Dark Side LH? Is this the final topo for this crag? Any more routes to go on here apart from those below?


**It has to End Somewhere (6a)** left of route 1: a slab trending leftwards to lower off.

**5. Rawlinson End (5)** worthwhile climbing up the wall to the shared belay

the extra routes are:

- the red line right of '9' is **Darkdale (6a)**
- ~~the red line left of 19 is actually the line of **Will They' (5)**~~ This is wrong? **Will They** is line 10 and there is no red line L of 19.
- the red line right of '21' is '**In Starke CONTRAST' (6b+)** &starf;
- the yellow line right of this is **Totally Stark' (6b+)**

This topo is also on [Dark Side Right](../harpur-hill-dark-side-right-hand/) but the route names are different.
