Staden Quarry is one of the surprises of the Peak, especially by the normal standard of its quarries. Three excellent pristine walls of grey limestone mixed with a very welcome atmosphere give three walls of superb climbing. Technique and a little boldness in places provides a venue for excellent climbs throughout with a variety of protection required and only the occasional use of in-situ gear.

## Approach

The quarry is situated to the east of Buxton close to the small village of Cowdale which is best reached via a minor road either off the A6 or A515 one mile to the east of Buxton. Once reached, park in a good area close to some garages at the top of a steep hill with some sharp bends. From here a good path leads easily into the quarry. Please park with consideration for the local villagers.

## Layout:

This is a large grassy floored quarried with three exceptionally good walls on very compact limestone. The walls all face north and can be cold and damp in the winter months but superb on warm days. Beware of midges in humid weather.
