The first routes start on the white rock just to the left of the main slab.

**1\. Steampunk (7b+) \*\*** starts at a large undercut flake left of the corner and goes up via two opposing boreholes through the bulges and overhangs above.

**2\. Last Act of Defiance (7a+) \*\*** line of bolts up the corner then swing out left to share the finish with Steampunk. Rebolted 2020

**3\. Project** the line of bolt studs up the arete and flying groove above.

**4\. Runaway Van (6c) \*** Start up a short arete and friable looking sidepull to gain the flat wall. Continue through the bulges to finish up the smooth headwall. High first bolt. Rebolted

**6\. Underground Resistence (7b+) \*\*** Bolt line left of Handy Wallhole to the grassy ledge.

**7\. Handy Wallhole (6c+) \*\*** climbs up the huge hole with the chain and slab above to the top of the crag. 30m.

**8\. Pop Art (6b+) \*\*** Climbs up the first 4 bolts of Handy Borehole before traversing into, and finishing up, Ascent Given. 30m

**9\. Ascent Given (7c) \*\*** hard climbing on the lower section gives way to a much easier top half. 30m.

**10\. Ascend the Underground (7c+) \*** A link-up. Starting up Ascent Given, traverse into Handy Wallhole, going up one move then move L into Underground Resistance a the white square and finish up this.
