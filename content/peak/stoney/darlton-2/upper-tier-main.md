Project

1. Alpha Whale (6b+)

Project

2. Fuji (7a) ** fine climbing finishing up a thin crack.

3. Superleggers (6c) ** a fine climb via the obvious cracklin with a difficult start

4. Spirit of Ectasy (6b) ** a bit of a 'pop' for a hold at the start and then superb pocket and jug pulling

5. Aperta (7a) * a face climb with some tough moves.

6. Superveloce (6c+) ** another excellent route, reachy low down and with a diffcult/trying move on the upper wall.

7. Stoked for the Send (6b) a pleasant little route to half hieght on the wall.

8. Psyched for the Stoke (6a+) shorter on the right and perhaps the wall's warm up route
