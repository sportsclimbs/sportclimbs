Project The furthest left line on the wall by a tree.

My Empire of Dirt (7a) finds a way up the wall via an intricate series of bouldery moves.

1. Rhubarb (6b+) branches left out of the right-hand line. Now much cleaner

2. Custard (6b+) the right-hand line has a tricky crux for all but the very tall.

There Will Be Crud (6b+) one tough move then it eases.

3. Latin Lingo (6a+) a steep route starting up the obvious crack.

4. Tower of Treats (6b)

5. Vlad (6a+)

6. Chunky (6b)

1. Bride of Chunky (6b+) the arete, difficult, to easier climbing

2. Lurid Persona (6b) a more balanced line

3. Cous Cous (6b+) more of a one move or two wonder

4. Downstream Takeaway (6b) the right-hand line gives a few good moves

Odd-bod junior (6a) is a RH start to Downstream Takeaway.
