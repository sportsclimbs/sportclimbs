The huge protruding buttress on the right-hand side of the track when walking down the dale from Topley Pike gives a number of classic traditional and sport pitches.


At the left-hand side of the buttress is a short wall with two sport routes:

- **Cupid Sails (6c)** a bulge and wall is the left-hand line</li>
- **Piccalilli Circus (6b)** the fingery right-hand line</li>

**1. Less of Your Lip (7b+)** the left-hand line moving left from the grassy ledge and with hard moves round the bulge.

**2. Liposuction (7b+)** branches left from the start of <em>A Bit Lippy</em> to climb roof. Pre-clip 3rd BR.

**3. A Bit Lippy (7b+)** Easier wall to boulder overhang Pre-clip 3rd BR.

**4. A Bit on the Side (6c)** &starf; branches left from the start to a pleasant open wall. A new direct start has been added.

**5. My Secret Life (7a)** &starf; juggy bulges and a hard move from the top break.

**6. The Wilderness Years (7b+) &starf;** long line up the left-hand side of the rounded arete with very definite crux.

**7. Scratch Race (7a)** &starf; directly up the arete with short hard section and technical interest above.

**8. The Massive (6b+)** &starf; takes the right-hand side of the arete with tricky moves and good rest.

**9. Stalk VS 4c** &starf;&starf; the large corner gained via its right-hand wall.

**10. Sparta in His Eyes (E1 5b)**

**11. Giants (6c)** &starf;&starf; big long route with superb varied climbing: technical lower bulge and juggy upper overhangs. A little friable on overlaps but cleaning up. (<a href="../../../img/peak/cheedale/Giants-2.jpg" title="photo of Giants on Plum Buttress">photo</a>)

**12. Gigantic (6c+) &starf;&starf;** an exciting righthand extension to Giants.

**13. Mrs Brown (7c)** &starf; long sports route with defined difficulties through the roofs

**14. Raisin Roof (E4 6a)**

**15. Big Plum E6 6c** &starf;&starf; central line with mean moves through large overhang.

**Damson in Distress (7c)** &starf;&starf; takes Mrs Brown to the roof then swings up and R into Big Plum and climbs it's crux. Move up and then traverse right into The Spider. Finish up this. Very exposed.

**16. The Spider (8a)** &starf;&starf;&starf; **the central roofs. Impressive.

**A Chip off the Old Block (7c+)** &starf; take Sloe Gin until over the first roof then make hard moves up and left to join The Spider. Finish up this.

**18. Sloe Gin (7c)** &starf;&starf; now climbed in one pitch to a lower off on Sirplum. 17** The original LH finish is seldom climbed.

**19. Sirplum HVS 4c, 5b** &starf;&starf;&starf; the original classic wandering up the face with the hardest moves from the mid-height belay.
