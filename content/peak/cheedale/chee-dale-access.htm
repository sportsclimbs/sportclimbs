            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p><img src="/img/peak/cheedale/chee3.gif" width="545" height="802">The dale is very easily accessible by car but parking for the dale is a little more tricky. If approaching from the north, take the A6 out of Buxton for 3 miles and locate a pay and display car park at the foot of a long inclined hill: the lower Topley Pike car par. At the top of this hill lies the less expensive (ie fre) Topley Pike upper car park. Both of these parking places allow access to the old railway track running into the valley either via a track from the pay and display car park or by descending the steep hill, gate in the wall and good path, from the upper car park This old railway track gives convenient access into the dale. </p>

            <p> From the east there are two methods: From the bottom of the hill on the B6049, itself gained from the A6 Buxton to Bakewell road or the A623 Chapel-en-le-Frith to Chesterfield road, take the small road signposted for Wormhill steeply for 100yards to a pay and display car park in an old station on the left. A track from this leads in 20 minutes into the southern end of the dale. </p>

            <p> Better is to continue up this road for 1 mile until a small cottage is seen on the left, the first building on the left, in the tiny hamlet of Wormhill: careful parking nearby. Descend a small track past the cottage and follow a small right-hand branch into the dale at a small footbridge. The first buttress, Rhubarb Buttress, lies 200 yards beyond this. </p>

            <p><strong>Access Note:</strong> Cheedale is a nature reserve subject to the strongest forms of envrionmental protection. There is no access by negotiated concession to all the right bank and much of the left bank. For detailed current access arrangements, please check the BMC 's Regional Access database.</p>
