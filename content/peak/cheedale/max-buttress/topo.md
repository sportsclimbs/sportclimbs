__Mix and Match (6a)__ left-hand of two warm-ups from part way up bank

__Maximum Potential (6a)__ left of chimney through upper overlap.

__1. Pepsi Max (6c)__ left-hand line of wall to and through the large roof.

Just to the right a traditional line leads to the roof. A step right and moves through the overlap gains 
the tree belay: __Max factor (E2 5b) *__

__2. Max Head Room (6c+) **__ obvious direct line to and through roof. Excellent.

A bold trad. line leads up the bald walls to the right with little protection: __Max wall (E5 6a **)__.

__3. Max Pax 'em In (7a) *__ direct from top of tiny groove. A difficult sequence

__4. Max 'is Wall (6c) **__ short technical wall to rest and fine upper scoop.

__5. Lunatic Fringe (6c+)__ tricky bulge and wall to easier climbing above. Joins last route.

__6. Max Pact (6b)__ warm up route through initial bulge and finish via wall left of groove.

__7. The Max Works (6c+) **__ a super little route trending rightwards from the ramp.

__8. Max to the Wall (7a+) *__ direct line via fine technical and fingery moves. Low in grade.

__9. Max A Million (7b) *__ the infamous reach route. You've either got it or you haven't.

__10. Maxonomy (7a+)__ contrived line to right. Stay on the line of the BRs.

__11. The Max Museum (7a+) *__ intense fingery line to right.

__12. Maxwell House (7b+) *__ running out of route names? Hard moves and harder clip of 2nd BR!

__13. Rough Justice (7c)__ getting even more intense and bouldery.

__14. A Bigger Max (7b+)__ another intense boulder problem.

__15. The Max They Love to Hate (7b) *__ a superb fingery problem starting on the stepping stones.

__16. Dream Thief (7a)__ begins on the first stepping stone of old.
