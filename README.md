## Questions

Should I use leaf bundles for pages. Each crag needs (mostly) several pages. Each crag needs a folder which will be a branch bundle with a `_index.md` file. Under that each page could be a leaf bundle.


## Types of page

1. Home page
2. crag top page with intro
3. crag map page (not always)
4. crag topo page/s
5. region page (peak / S Wales / N Wales / Yorkshire / Dorset?)
6. area page (cheedale, stoney, Matlock, Buxton etc.)



## To do

1. Figure out how to link different pages to different layouts
2. How to range through a branch bundle
